The performance of a systems under MPC and LQR are compared. MPC has been implemented using the cplex solver. Under a theoretically characterized maximal disturbance and measurement noise bound characterized as a part of my thesis, the response of system under MPC and LQR (in the presence or abence of anomalies, i.e., faults or cyberattacks) is similar. This has been demonstrated via the 2 illustrative examples (a) building system space conditioned by HVAC systems and (b) a nonlinear continuous stirred tank reactor.
